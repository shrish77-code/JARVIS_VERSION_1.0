Shrish: : write the code of Sudoku.
Jarvis: : Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, such that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains each number only once.

Here's a simple implementation of Sudoku in Python:

```python
def print_board(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i != 0:
            print("- - - - - - - - - - - -")

        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if j % 3 == 0 and j != 0:
                print(" | ", end="")

            if j == 8:
                print(board[i][j])
            else:
                print(str(board[i][j]) + " ", end="")

def find_empty(board):
    for i in range(len(board)):
        for j in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                return (i, j)  # row, col

    return None

def valid(board, num, pos):
    # check row
    for i in range(len(board[0])):
        if board[pos[0]][i] == num and pos[1] != i:
            return False

    # check column
    for i in range(len(board)):
        if board[i][pos[1]] == num and pos[0] != i:
            return False

    # check box
    box_x = pos[1] // 3
    box_y = pos[0] // 3

    for i in range(box_y*3, box_y*3 + 3):
        for j in range(box_x * 3, box_x*3 + 3):
            if board[i][j] == num and (i,j) != pos:
                return False

    return True

def solve(board):
    find = find_empty(board)
    if not find:
        return True
    else:
        row, col = find

    for i in range(1, 10):
        if valid(board, i, (row, col)):
            board[row][col] = i

            if solve(board):
                return True

            board[row][col] = 0

    return False

board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

if solve(board):
    print_board(board)
else:
    print("No solution exists")
```

This code uses a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It first checks if there are any empty cells in the board. If there are none, it returns True. Otherwise, it tries to fill the empty cell with numbers from 1 to 9. If it finds a number that is valid in the current position, it recursively calls the solve function to fill the rest of the board. If it cannot find a valid number for the current empty cell, it backtracks and tries the next number.

When you run this code, it will print the solved Sudoku board.
